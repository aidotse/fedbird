Project design

* FEDn interfaces

** Description - please update is misconception  

FEDn client is interface the client code via
the project.yaml file with the following interface:
Member
  - name:
  - entry_points:
    - predict:
        - command:
    - train:
        - command:
    - validate:
        - command

For FEDn, is it enough entry points ? Would we need to introduce new
ones ? Are this entry point mandatory or optional ?

* PySyft interface

* HPE interface
