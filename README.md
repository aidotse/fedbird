# MNIST test project
This classsic example of hand-written text recognition is well suited both as a lightweight test when learning FEDn and developing on FEDn in psedo-distributed mode. A normal high-end laptop or a workstation should be able to sustain at least 5 clients. The example is also useful for general scalability tests in fully distributed mode. 

## Setting up a client

### Provide local training and test data
This example assumes that trainig and test data is available as 'test/mnist/data/train.csv' and 'test/mnist/data/test.csv'. Data can be downloaded from e.g. https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv, but there are several hosted versions available. To make testing flexible, each client subsamples from this dataset upon first invokation of a training request, then cache this subsampled data for use for the remaining lifetime of the client. The subsample size is configured as described in the next section. 

### Configuring the tests
We have made it possible to configure a couple of settings to vary the conditions for the training. These configurations are expsosed in the file 'settings.yaml': 

```yaml 
# Number of training samples used by each client
training_samples: 600
# Number of test samples used by each client (validation)
test_samples: 100
# How much to bias the client data samples towards certain classes (non-IID data partitions)
bias: 0.7
# Parameters for local training
batch_size: 32
epochs: 1
```

### Creating a compute package
To train a model in FEDn you provide the client code (in 'client') as a tarball (you set the name of the package in 'settings-reducer.yaml'). For convenience, we ship a pre-made package. Whenever you make updates to the client code (such as altering any of the settings in the above mentioned file), you need to re-package the code (as a .tar.gz archive) and copy the updated package to 'packages'. From 'test/mnist':

```bash
tar -cf mnist.tar client
gzip mnist.tar
cp mnist.tar.gz packages/
```

## Creating a seed model
The baseline CNN is specified in the file 'client/init_model.py'. This script creates an untrained neural network and serialized that to a file, which is uploaded as the seed model for federated training. For convenience we ship a pregenerated seed model in the 'seed/' directory. If you wish to alter the base model, edit 'init_model.py' and regenerate the seed file:

```bash
python init_model.py 
```

## Start the client
The easiest way to start clients for quick testing is by using Docker. We provide a docker-compose template for convenience. First, edit 'fedn-network.yaml' to provide information about the reducer endpoint. Then:

```bash
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up --scale client=2 
```
> Note that this assumes that a FEDn network is running (see separate deployment instructions). The file 'docker-compose.dev.yaml' is for testing againts a local pseudo-distributed FEDn network. Use 'docker-compose.yaml' if you are connecting against a reducer part of a distributed setup and provide a 'extra_hosts' file.
